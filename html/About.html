                    Throughout man's growth and development, GIS has played a crucial role to facilitate the same.
                    But what is GIS? What does it really entail? Does it really matter?
                    You are about to find out. <br> <br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    GIS in full means <i>Geographic Information System</i>. It is
                    a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will, 
                    transforming and displaying spatial data from the real world for a particular set 
                    of purposes.‚Äù (Burrough 1986). <br> <br>
                    Such a tool has proven to be very useful in man's everyday life.
                    From navigation to even agriculture, GIS has got you covered.

                    Our common definition of sensing refers to sight, hearing,
                    smell, taste, or touch.
                    We are detecting, perceiving, or becoming aware of some 
                    phenomena external to us. <br> <br>

                    The moment we sense objects from a distance without
                    physical contact, we do so <i>remotely</i>.But what is Remote Sensing? <br> <br>
                    Remote sensing is the science, technology, and art of obtaining
                    information about an object, area, or phenomenon by analyzing
                    data acquired by a device (remote sensor) that is not in physical
                    direct contact with the object, area or phenomenon under
                    investigation.

                    A GIS has several components that enable it to function holistically.
                    They include: <br>
                </p>

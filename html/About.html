                    Throughout man's growth and development, GIS has played a crucial role to facilitate the same.
                    But what is GIS? What does it really entail? Does it really matter?
                    You are about to find out. <br> <br>

                <p>
                    GIS in full means <i>Geographic Information System</i>. It is
                    a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will, 
                    transforming and displaying spatial data from the real world for a particular set 
                    of purposes.” (Burrough 1986). <br> <br>
                    Such a tool has proven to be very useful in man's everyday life.
                    From navigation to even agriculture, GIS has got you covered.

                    Our common definition of sensing refers to sight, hearing,
                    smell, taste, or touch.
                    We are detecting, perceiving, or becoming aware of some 
                    phenomena external to us. <br> <br>

                    The moment we sense objects from a distance without
                    physical contact, we do so <i>remotely</i>.But what is Remote Sensing? <br> <br>
                    Remote sensing is the science, technology, and art of obtaining
                    information about an object, area, or phenomenon by analyzing
                    data acquired by a device (remote sensor) that is not in physical
                    direct contact with the object, area or phenomenon under
                    investigation.

                    A GIS has several components that enable it to function holistically.
                    They include: <br>
                </p>

                <ul>

                <p>
                    Hardware is the computer on which a GIS operates. 
                    These are devices that the user interacts with directly in 
                    carrying out GIS operations, by typing, pointing, clicking,
                    or speaking, and which returns information by 
                    displaying it on the device's screen or generating meaningful sounds. <br>
                    An office desktop, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), in
                    devices, and even cellular (mobile) phones or vehicles constitute the various
                    hardware available. <br>
                    Today, GIS software runs on a wide range of hardware types, from 
                    centralized computer servers to desktop computers used in stand-alone 
                    or networked configurations. <br>
                    Other peripheral devices that are used in the input and output of the 
                    GIS query results include scanners, digitizers, for input, and plotters 
                    and printers for the output.

                    GIS software provides the functions and tools needed to store, 
                    analyze, and display geographic information. Key software 
                    components are:
                    Tools for the input and manipulation of geographic information
                    A database management system (DBMS)
                    Tools that support geographic query, analysis, and visualization
                    A graphical user interface (GUI) for easy access to tools
                    The software can be as simple as a standard Web browser (e.g. 
                    Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox. Google Chrome,Opera, etc.) if all 
                    processing is done remotely on services offered on large servers, to 
                    stand-alone software running on the individual’s desktop computer.
                    GIS software available include 
                    simple to complex packages
                    available 
                    from GIS vendors, to free customizable ones that are freely available 
                    in the Internet.

                <p>
                    Possibly the most important component of a GIS
                    Geographic data and related tabular data can be collected in-house 
                    or purchased from a commercial data provider.
                    A GIS will integrate spatial data with other data resources, and can 
                    even use a DBMS used by most organizations to organize and 
                    maintain their data to manage spatial data. 
                    Data present in a GIS includes:
                    Geometry data
                    : Points, Lines, polygons (areas) and raster cell.
                    Attributive data
                    : information about the geometry data
                    Multimedia data:
                    some GIS support other formats of data such as 
                    audio, video, sequences of picture, time.
                    GIS databases range from a few megabytes to as large as a terabyte

                    GIS technology is of limited value without the people who manage 
                    the system and develop plans for applying it to real-world problems.
                    Users range from technical specialists, who design and maintain the 
                    system, to those who use it to help them perform their everyday work.
                    People associated with a GIS can be categorized into
                    general users, and GIS specialists.
                    Viewers 
                    : viewers, 
                    are the public at large whose only need is to browse a geographic 
                    database for referential material. These constitute the largest class of users.
                    General Users 
                    are people who use GIS to conducting business, performing 
                    professional services, and making decisions. They include facility 
                    managers, resource managers, planners, scientists, engineers, lawyers, 
                    business entrepreneurs, etc.
                    GIS specialists 
                    are the people who make the GIS work. They include GIS 
                    managers, database administrators, application specialists, systems 
                    analysts, and programmers. They are responsible for the maintenance of 
                    the geographic database and the provision of technical support to the other 
                    two classes of users.

                    Network
                    is the additional and probably the most fundamental 
                    component of the GIS, without which no rapid communication or 
                    sharing of digital information could occur.
                    GIS today relies heavily on the Internet and on the intranets of 
                    corporations, agencies, and the military in delivering applications.
                    Users can access GIS, without the software installed in their 
                    computers, from remote servers. Distributed users, through the 
                    network, can access a centralized GIS.
                    The network component has enabled many people to utilize GIS 
                    capabilities even without the knowledge that they are using GIS 
                    services in their problem solutions
